BlueBird provides a common [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask)-based API to multiple air traffic simulators. In addition to basic communication, it also includes features such as state caching, performance metrics (via [Aviary](https://github.com/project-bluebird/aviary)), and logging of scenario data. The main purpose of BlueBird is to provide a common interface to ease the research & development of AI for air traffic control.

The currently supported open-source simulator is [BlueSky](https://github.com/project-bluebird/bluesky).
